v2.0


v2.0 changes: June 2021
-switched to standard names for registers
 (defines.asm now called regs.asm)
-OAM_Meta_Spr is more efficient, handles overflow
-OAM_Spr changed for the better
-OAM_Clear is more efficient
-! changed name convention (some other name changes)
 variable, Function, CONSTANT (ARRAY)
-snesgss -> snesgssQ (added echo functions)
-many of the macros have been changed
-added some sprite collision code (added to example)
-handles lag frames better
-more efficient init code
-added an hdma variable (used by NMI code)
-you shouldn't have to call Reset_VRAM_System anymore



for ca65 assembler, to develop SNES games.
based on neslib.s by Shiru





The stack starts at 1fff (recommend you don't change it)
direct page is at 0000 (recommend you don't move it)

all these functions, jsl to them (or use their macro)

the nmi code automatically sets scroll, copies the sprites
to the OAM, and (if there was a palette change) copies
the palette to the CGRAM.

also, there is an optional automated dma system for
vram updates.



I still have bugs with register sizes, particularly
using macros that change the register size invisibly.
It will be a good idea to keep a comment below each
macro about the register size set by the macro.



All the DMAs use channel 0. Recommend you use only
use channels 1-7 for HDMA. Set this variable
to activate HDMA and it will turn on during NMI.
  lda #$fe
  ;or lda #2 or #6, anything but 1
  sta hdma_active

or turn off
  stz hdma_active ;a8



BG_Mode:
to set the bg mode. A = 0-7 =  mode

  A8
  lda #1
  jsl BG_Mode
  
or...
  SET_BG_MODE  1


BG3_Priority:
to set the background 3 priority bit in $2105.
if A=0, bg3 will always be behind bg 1 and 2.
if A=8, bg3 tiles with priority bit clear will be behind
bg 1 and 2, bg3 tiles with priority bit set will be
in front of bg 1 and 2.

BG1_Map_Addr:
to set the vram address of the tilemap for bg1.
In steps of $400, A = high byte.
Also, it sets a variable to the address called bg1_map_base

BG1_Map_Size:
to set the size of the tile map. 32x32,32x64,64x32, or 64x64
see examples in regs.asm, such as MAP_32_32.

* note 32x32 maps use $400 words
  32x64 and 64x32 maps use $800 words
  64x64 maps use $1000 words
** words means 2 bytes, each vram address uses 2 bytes 


Map_Offset:
to get a vram address of a specific tile. This version works
for 32x32, 32x64, and 64x32 sized maps.
(AXY in 16 bit) 
* changed to keep xy consistently 16 bit
returns A = address offset, which you need to add to the
base address, such as bg1_map_base.
X = 0-31 or 0-63, Y = 0-31 or 0-63 = the x and y tile positions.
if you have pixel coordinates 0-255, divide by 8 (for 8x8 tiles)
Note: y max 27 if non-scrolling and screen size 224 pixel tall
	AXY16
	ldx #3
	ldy #10
	jsl Map_Offset
	(returns A16 = the offset for the 3rd column, 10th row, tile)
	clc
	adc bg1_map_base ;if in bg 1
	(now have the exact address of that tile)
	
or...    
(you can use this for compile time constants, for 32x32 maps only)
  MAP_OFFSET(tile_x,tile_y)


Map_Offset6464:
same as map_offset, for 64x64 sized tilemaps.
X = 0-63, Y = 0-63.



OAM_Clear:
clears the sprite buffer. Do at the start of each frame.
  jsl OAM_Clear
  

OAM_Size:
sets the sizes of sprites.
see examples in regs.asm, such as OAM_8_16 for
8x8 small sprites and 16x16 large sprites.
(A in 8 bit, do any time)
  A8
  lda #OAM_8_16
  jsl OAM_Size
  
or...  
  SET_OAM_SIZE  OAM_8_16
  
  
OAM_Tile_Addr:
sets the vram address for the sprite tiles.
in steps of $2000. A = 0-3
(A in 8 bit, do any time) 
  A8
  lda #2 ;vram $4000
  jsl OAM_Tile_Addr
  
or...(use the full address)
  SET_OAM_TILE_ADDR  $4000
  
  
OAM_Spr:
to put 1 sprite on the screen. first set
each of these 5 variables, then call OAM_Spr

spr_x (9 bit)
spr_y (8 bit)
spr_c (tile #) (8 bit)
spr_a (flip, palette, priority) (8 bit)
spr_sz = sprite size, 0 or 2 (sm or lg)

see constants in regs.asm for attributes, such as
SPR_PAL_2, SPR_PRIOR_0, and SPR_H_FLIP.
  A8
  lda #$10 ;x position of 10
  sta spr_x
  stz spr_x+1 ;9th bit zero
  lda #$20 ;y position of 21*
  sta spr_y
  lda #$30 ;tile $30
  sta spr_c
  lda #SPR_PAL_2|SPR_PRIOR_2 ;palette #2, priority of 2
  sta spr_a
  lda #SPR_SIZE_SM ;small (depends on oam settings)
  sta spr_sz
  jsl OAM_Spr
  
*yes, sprites appear 1 pixel low, just like NES
** you don't need to rewrite these between calls to
OAM_Spr, like if you are drawing multiple sprites with
the same size, attributes, and tile #, you can just
adjust only spr_x and spr_y between calls to OAM_Spr.


OAM_Meta_Spr:
put multiple sprites on screen. 
First, copy all the sprite values to these variables
  spr_x = x (9 bit)
  spr_y = y (8 bit)
Then, load AX with the address of the meta sprite data.

The data is 5 bytes per sprite, ending in 128
relative x, relative y, tile #, attributes, size
(see constants in regs.asm for attributes)
(the data can be generated by the SPEZ app)
  A8 
  lda #$10 ;or y variable
  sta spr_y

  lda #$01ff ;or x variable, 9 bit
  sta spr_x
  lda #.loword(MetaspriteData)
  ldx #^MetaspriteData
  jsl OAM_Meta_Spr


Pad_Poll:
reads both controllers to these variables:
pad1, pad1_new, pad2, pad2_new
Do it at the start of each frame.
  jsl Pad_Poll
  
 
Rand16:
returns A = 16 bit random #
  A16
  jsl Rand16
  
 
Seed_Rand:
pass a 16 bit # to seed the random # generator
probably best to wait till the user presses a button
to seed with an actual random number.
  A16
  lda frame_count
  jsl Seed_Rand
  
 

  

-----------------------------------
| vram buffer system for auto-dma |
-----------------------------------


Reset_VRAM_System:
to reset the variables.
You shouldn't have to call this... the system itself calls
this at the end (in NMI). I put a call to it in the init
code, in case the user hits reset at the wrong time.
  jsl Reset_VRAM_System
  
  
The VRAM system is a 2 step process. First you copy the
data to a buffer with Copy_To_VB, then you call either
VB_Buffer_H or VB_Buffer_V. There is a way to skip the
Copy_To_VB part, if the data is already somewhere in
the $7e bank, by just setting all the variables needed
by VB_Buffer_H, which are...
  src_address_vb ;pointer to the data
  dst_address_vb ;vram address destination
  num_bytes_vb ;how many bytes to transfer
  

Copy_To_VB:
to copy some data to the buffer. This would be step 1.
Internally, it sets some variables...
src_address and num_bytes.
AX = address of the data to be copied.
Y = # of bytes.
  AXY16
  lda #.loword(raw_data)
  ldx #^raw_data
  ldy #100 ;to copy 100 bytes
  jsl Copy_To_VB
  

VB_Buffer_H:
to set a pointer to the data we just copied, and set up
an auto-dma to go left to right. (to transfer at the next nmi).
step 2 would be to calculate a vram address and pass
that # to the variable dst_address, then step 3 is 
to call VB_Buffer_H
  A16
  lda #$6123 ;vram address
  sta dst_address
  jsl VB_Buffer_H

  
VB_Buffer_V:
same as VB_Buffer_H, except the data will go top to bottom
when copied to the vram (+32 increment mode)

 
  


VRAM_Read:
read some data from the vram to wram.
First set a vram address and increment mode.
;a = destination address
;x = destination bank

  jsl VRAM_Read
  
or...  
  READ_FROM_VRAM  wram_dst, length
  
  
DMA_VRAM:
to copy data from wram or rom to the vram.
First set a vram address and increment mode.
;a = source address
;x = source bank
;y = length in bytes
(AXY in 16 bit, forced blank or v-blank)
  A8
  lda #V_INC_1 ;make sure the increment mode is 1

  jsl DMA_VRAM
  
or...(after setting a vram address)
  DMA_TO_VRAM  src_address, length
  
  

mem_clear: use WRAM_Fill_7E or WRAM_Fill_7F, fill value 0
  

WRAM_Fill_7E:

x16 = start address (in 7e0000 bank)
y16 = size in bytes
WARNING, do not clear the stack or this will never return.

VRAM_Fill:
to fill an area of vram with an 8 bit value.
first set a vram address and increment mode.

music.asm
---------

Shiru wrote the SNES GSS tracker and SPC driver code.
The asm code has been modified to work with ca65.
Apparently, there is a bug in the original SPC code,
which has been patched, and also echo functions were
added (but streaming audio was removed)

Use the snesgssQ tracker, and export the SPC700.bin (holds
the SPC driver and the brr samples) and each song...
music_1.bin. Include them in the game code with
.incbin "file"


SPC_Init:
to load the SPC driver into the SPC. Pass it a
pointer to the SPC700.bin file.
  AXY16
  lda #.loword(music_code)
  ldx #^music_code
  jsl SPC_Init
;NOTE, this could take a long time.


SPC_Load_Data:
to load data to the SPC. You shouldn't need to
call this directly. It uses stack relative
addressing, so you would need to push
several values to the stack before hand.


SPC_Play_Song:
to load a song (after SPC_init) to the SPC,
and start it playing. It first calls the
stop command, so you shouldn't need to do that.
  AXY16
  lda #.loword(song_address)
  ldx #^song_address
  jsl SPC_Play_Song


SPC_Command_ASM:
to send a command to the SPC. Don't call this
directly. It uses stack relative to pass values.


SPC_Stereo:
to set either mono or stereo. A16 = 0 or 1.
the init code sets it to mono by default.
  A16
  lda #0 (mono) or 1 (stereo)
  jsl SPC_Stereo
  

SPC_Global_Volume:
to set global volume and speed. I'm not entirely
sure if the speed value is different from the
value used by the SNESGSS tracker, which is 0-99
(fast-slow) but volume should be 0-127.
  AXY16
  lda #speed
  ldx #volume
  jsl SPC_Global_Volume
  
 
SPC_Channel_Volume:
to change the max volume for a specific channel 0-7
  AXY16
  lda #channels 0-7
  ldx #volume   0-127
  jsl SPC_Channel_Volume
  
 
Music_Stop:
to stop the music, but not sound effects.
  jsl Music_Stop
  

Music_Pause:
to pause and unpause, a16 is 0 or 1
  A16
  lda #0 (unpause) or 1 (pause)
  jsl Music_Pause

  
Sound_Stop_All:
to stop music and sound effects.
  jsl Sound_Stop_All
  

SFX_Play:
you shouldn't have to call this directly.
uses stack relative to push all values.
use the following...


SFX_Play_Center:
to play a sound effect pan center. AXY is 8 bit.
;in a= sfx #
;	x= volume 0-127
;	y= sfx channel, needs to be > than max song channel
  AXY8
  lda #0 ;the first sfx
  ldx #127 ;volume
  ldy #7 ;the top channel
  jsl SFX_Play_Center


SFX_Play_Left:
same, but pan left.


SFX_Play_Right:
same, but pan right.


SPC streaming was removed.

-for snesgssQ fork
sets the echo volume. turn echo channels on/off.
  AXY8
  lda #echo volume 0-$7f (0 = off)
  ldx #which channels on? (bit field, each bit = a channel)

! echo address needs to be > the last spc file byte
  AXY8
  lda #echo start address highbyte
  ldx #echo delay (0-$f), should be 0-5
